<h1>Privacy Policy <img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tiny4_9_11/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-cool.gif" alt="cool" /></h1>
<p>So I have decided to make a privacy policy due to some silly goofy laws. So I guess enjoy reading if you want because lets be honest here, who in god's name reads a privacy policy? THATS RIGHT, YOU DO YOU PSYCHO!</p>
<h2>Discord Verification &amp; Restoration</h2>
<p>As most of you know, I use <a href="https://restorecord.com">RestoreCord</a>'s services for Discord Verification and Backup just incase of a raid, and as most of you also know, RC does log your Client IP, Country, and ISP. However if any of you are concerned about this, only very VERY higher ups inside of our community are able to do this, and every one of us will never use your information for malicious purposes. We simply collect this data to prevent the usage of bots in our server, which can prevent a raid. The restoration part of RestoreCord allows me to re-add possibly banned/kicked discord members to the server if it was raided. If you do not feel comfortable with this, you may Deauthorize ZenBot in your Discord User Settings.</p>
<h2>Underage Users</h2>
<p>The LegitZenith's Projects discord server works its hardest to comply with <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord TOS</a>, so we do not allow anybody under the age of 13 to access our Discord server. If we find out somebody may be under the age of 13, we perform an investigation to ensure this is not an accusation. If we do confirm you are under the age of 13, we will give you a temporary ban for 5 years if we don't know your age, or for 5-1 year(s) if we find out how long it will be until you have reached the age of 13.</p>
<h2>Information Collection for Underage Users</h2>
<p>As stated in "Discord Verification &amp; Restoration" we collect user's information. To comply with laws in certain USA states and foreign countries, if we find a user to be under the age of 13, we will remove all of their personal information/data from our logs.</p>
